# OpenRepo
Create repo systems with ease. Developed by [Zenith](https://zenithdevs.com).

### About
OpenRepo is all about ease. You shouldn't need to do too much work to get your app up and running. We took that mindset and developed an easy-to-use repo manager in JavaScript. The possiblities are endless for creations with repos, so we think everyone should be able to get in on the fun. As an added benefit, we patch cross-site scripting (XSS) for you! It uses ES6, so expect issues on older devices.
